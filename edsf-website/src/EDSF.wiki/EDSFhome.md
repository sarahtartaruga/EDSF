# EDISON Initiative

EDISON initiative is a community initiative that involves developers and adopters of the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) that has been developed by the EDISON project and widely adopted and recognised worldwide with the purpose to continue maintenance and further development of EDSF.

The University of Amsterdam (UvA) team, initial EDSF developer, will work as an interim coordinator and faciltator with the view to create the community delegated coordination group that will oversee wider EDSF development and implementation.

Participation in the EDISON/EDSF initiative and Open Source project is open to any party who can contribute with the framework development, implementation, promotion and sponsoring or funding.

The github project [https://github.com/EDISONcommunity/EDSF/](https://github.com/EDISONcommunity/EDSF/) serves as a hub for all future activities on the EDSF development, call for contribution and search for new funding and/or sponsorship.

The content of the wiki will grow with the time and will integrate the EDISON project legacy information under new EDISON Project website/domain http://edison-project.net/

# EDSF maintenance and development

The EDSF release 2 was published on 7 July 2017 as a final deliverable of the EDISON project. Since that time the EDSF has undergone validation and practical implementation in a number of organisations and education and training courses. Significant experience and multiple feedbacks have been collected.

New EDSF Release 3 was published on 31 December 2018 and can be referred to as "EDSF Release 3" or "EDSF2018".
The EDSF Release 3 is available from the EDSF project root as current working version https://github.com/EDISONcommunity/EDSF

List of EDISON related publications is available here http://www.uazone.org/demch/academic/papers-edu.html

# Further development and Call for contribution 

The EDSF Release 3 was discussed and comments and contributions reviewed during the EDSF Release 3 Design workshop that took place on 18-19 July 2018 at the University of Amsterdam (see [workshop page](https://github.com/EDISONcommunity/EDSF/wiki/(1)-EDSF-Release-3-Design-Workshop-18-19-July-2018-(UvA)) for details).
