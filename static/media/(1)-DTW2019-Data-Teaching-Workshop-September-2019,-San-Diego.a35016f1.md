# 2019 Data Teaching Workshop – 5th Workshop on Curricula and Teaching Methods in Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Data Science

## as part of 15th eScience Conference  (https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/), September 24 – 27, 2019, San Diego, California, USA

Paper submission: 5 July  2019

## Scope
The emergence of Data Science technologies that combine Cloud Computing, Big Data and Data Analytics technologies as specialized fields in computing is motivating development of new teaching methods in course design  to provide education in the techniques and technologies needed to extract knowledge from large datasets in virtualized environment. In current literature there is a lack of well-articulated learning resource for beginners that would integrate administrative, programing, and algorithm design aspects of related domains. We believe it is important to allow students, researchers, and professionals to understand cross-domain aspects of these challenges before they embark on further exploration of these fields.

The workshop will be organizationally sponsored by the EDISON Initiative supported by the partners of the EDISON project, which was funded by the European Community to coordinate Data Science curricula development in Europe and internationally.

We plan to accept a small number of high-quality contributions for presentation during the workshop. At the end of the workshop, a forum discussion is planned to debate on future directions of curricula and teaching methods in Data Science, Big Data, and Cloud Computing

## Topics

The workshop invites papers discussing topics related to teaching methods, platforms and best practices in the following areas applied to one of the fields (Cloud Computing, DevOps, Big Data, Data Science) or closely related to them:
-	novel or updated curricula reflecting continuously developing technologies; 
-	novel or updated teaching methods, e.g. Bloom’s taxonomy for new types of Data Science and Big Data courses, flipped classroom, etc ;
-	review and presentation of novel teaching materials;
-	review of methodologies;
-	characterization of domain knowledge (Body of Knowledge);
-	adoption as a part of institutional strategies;
-	review and analysis of existing practices in the design, implementation, and evaluation;
-	multimedia and interactive components in residential and online education, educational platforms, MOOCs and others; 
-	cooperation between universities/academia and industry in delivering advanced education and leadership programs;
-	implementation reports and lessons learnt;
-	future trends and issues.
